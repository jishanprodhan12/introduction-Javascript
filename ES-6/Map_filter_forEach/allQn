/**
 *1) You have an odd array(array with odd numbers). [1,3,5,7,9].
 * Now convert this array into a eben array with even numbers . [2,4,6,8,10]. do this using for loop and array dot map method.hints: Add one to any odd number and it will become an even number.
 * 
 * 
 * 
 * 2) You are giving an array says: [33,50,79,78,90,101,30].Now return/Get all the elements which are divisible by 10 using array.filter() method .
 * now do the same task of question 2. but do this using array.find() method . then compare the output of question 2 & question 3 .
 * 
 * 
 * 
 * 3) you have an array of objects: 
    const instructor = [
         {name: 'nodi' , age:28 , position:'Senior}, 
         {name: 'Akil' , age:26 , position:'Junior}, 
         {name: 'Shobuj' , age:30 , position:'Senior}
     ];
Your task is display the insturctor names that has the position is Senior using filter .


4) reduce()
    const pepole = [
            {name: 'Meena' , age: 20},
            {name: 'Rina' , age: 15},
            {name: 'Suchorita' , age: 22}
    
    ];
1) Follow above array of objects . So you have 3 objects as array element. Can you find out the total sum from here ?
        20+15+22 = 57 . The output will be 57
What are you thinking ? Yeah ! Do it with for loop . I know you can do it .
But! Wait!! Wait!!! Do the same task using array.reduce() method .
